# Go Booking App Learning Path - README

Welcome to the **Go Booking App Learning Path**! This guide will walk you through the process of building a booking application using the Go programming language. Along the way, you'll learn key Go concepts, including basics, variables, arrays, loops, conditional statements, functions, structs and goroutines.


## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
1. **Go Installed**: Download and install Go from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. **Basic Programming Knowledge**: Familiarity with any programming language is helpful but not mandatory.


## Learning Path Outline

### 1. **Setting Up the Project**
   - **Objective**: Create your Go project structure.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Install Go.
     2. Create a folder for the project.
     3. Initialize the project using `go mod init booking-app`.
   - **Outcome**: Understand how to set up a Go environment and manage dependencies.

---

### 2. **Go Basics**
   - **Objective**: Get comfortable with Go syntax.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Hello World program.
     - Declaring variables and constants.
     - Printing to the console using `fmt`.
---

### 3. **Variables, Arrays, and Loops**
   - **Objective**: Work with user data.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Declaring and initializing variables.
     - Arrays and slices.
     - Using `for` loops.

---

### 4. **If-Else Statements**
   - **Objective**: Add decision-making to your application.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Conditional statements.
     - Validating user input.

---

### 5. **Functions**
   - **Objective**: Modularize your code.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Defining and calling functions.
     - Functions with parameters and return values.

---

### 6. **Go Routines**
   - **Objective**: Handle concurrent tasks.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Understanding goroutines.
     - Implementing concurrent operations for booking confirmation.

---

## Final Project
**Objective**: Combine everything learned to build the booking app.  
**Features**:
1. Allow users to book seats.
2. Validate input and check seat availability.
3. Store booking information using maps.
4. Use goroutines for sending booking confirmations asynchronously.

---

## Running the Application
1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the app using:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
